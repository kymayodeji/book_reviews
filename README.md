### Book Reviews
## Objective
Does the report include a paragraph detailing the main objective(s) of this analysis? 
When deciding if to read a book or not, many readers browse reveiws of the book to decide on the quality of the book. Unfortunately, for mystery afficionados and romance enthusiasts, a review can also include one or more spoilers. A spoiler is information or description about important plot details that more than likely will reduce the suspense or interest in completing the book. For those readers who do not want to encounter any spoilers while reading a book review, a spoiler detection model would be ideal. In this project, I will use a collection of books from a 2017 webscraping of book reviews from the popular site, GoodRead, to train a model to detect reviews that contain spoilers.

## Dataset
Does the report include a section describing the data?
The dataset was collected from a late 2017 web scraping of public bookshelves on the GoodReads [website](https://www.goodreads.com) for research done by [Mengtin Gwan](https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads.html) for the "Item Recommendation on Monotonic Behavior Chains", in RecSys'18. [bibtex] paper. The dataset contains over 15 million reviews written by four hundred thousands users ror over 2 million books. 


## Recurrent Neural Network model
Does the report include a section with variations of a Deep Learning model and specifies which one is the model that best suits the main objective(s) of this analysis?

## Key Findings
Does the report include a clear and well presented section with key findings related to the main objective(s) of the analysis?

## Next Steps
Does the report highlight possible flaws in the model and a plan of action to revisit this analysis with additional data or different modeling techniques?
